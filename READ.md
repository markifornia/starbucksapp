Starbucks App

I created this json file (yes I know it's a php file but I chose to use one file to encoding the object via json_encode() function). I sat at a local starbucks I kept staring at the menu so I decided to write what I saw - The standard starbucks menu.

My idea was motivated by my recent in capturing constant objects in the real world. There obviously an infinite amount of objects I would have chosen, but if you ever bump into me at a local coffee shop, I would explain why I chose this particular object class.

You may have noticed the menu is incomplete - if you wish to add to the menu, suggest a more logical way in constructing parent child nodes, feel free to do so.
